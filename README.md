# YOUR AVERAGE FUNKO!

## ABOUT

This application is all about connecting with other funko pop enthuasists and being able to view and chat about their collections and interests in the wonderful hobby of funko pop collecting.

A user is able to search through a database with well over 10,000 funko pops by series, name or number. They can add funko pops that they already own to their collection, or add the ones that they think are really cool to a want list! You can also move funko pops from your want list to owned as your collection grows, or delete ones that you don't have anymore! You can do it all with your Average Funko.

Since there really is no current Funko Pop API readily available, I was tasked with creating a script to collect the data myself. I wrote custom functions to scrape websites to be able to collect all the data on well over 10,000 funko pops that included the series, name, and number of each funko pop.

## Functionality

_FUNKO POP SEARCHING_

    A user can use the 'search collection' feature that will allow them to sift through all the series/genres in our database and look to try and collect all the funko pops in that one collection.

    Or, if the user wants to look up all the funko pops that pertain to 'Thor', they can just use the search feature by name, and have all the funko pops that deal with Thor to look through.

    My personal favorite though, searching a random funko pop number and being able to see all funkos that come up with that same number! That is a fun way to find different pops just based on a goofy stat like the funko pop number.

_USER PROFILE/CHAT_

    Users are able to search through a list of other fellow funko pop users, click on them to see their complete funko pop collection including their want list.

    You are also able to send direct messages to the user that you click on to view their profile. This way, you can chat about funko pops that the other user has and funkos that the other use finds cool or is interested in. Compare collections and even set up possible trades or whatever each user would like to do!

    Messages section in the navbar will alert to new messages that are sent to a user, and will update dynamically based on recieving messages - just like a personal chat feature.

## Future Updates

- Have a link for each funko pop to be able to bring up various websites that deal with the hobby (example could be cardboardcollection or funko website)
- Have pricing on funko pops to see what they sell/buy for
- Keep up on new funko pop releases (hopefully every month)
- Expand on user profile - add profile avatar updating (in the works already), display room where users can upload photos of their own collections to show off how each user displays their own funko pops
- Add table for users collection and want list (table like when searching for funko pops or going through series/genres)
